Server-side code can be written in any number of programming languages â€” 
examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript (NodeJS).
The server-side code has full access to the server operating system and the developer can 
choose what programming language (and specific version) 
they wish to use.
Developers typically write their code using web frameworks.
Web frameworks are collections of functions, objects, rules and other code constructs designed to solve common problems,
speed up development, and simplify the different types of tasks faced in a particular domain.
Server-side programming is very useful because it allows us to efficiently deliver information tailored for individual users and thereby create a much better user experience.

Companies like Amazon use server-side programming to construct search results for products,
make targeted product suggestions based on client preferences and previous
buying habits, simplify purchases, etc.
