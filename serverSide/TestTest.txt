Server-side programming allows sites to restrict access to authorized users and serve only the information that a user is permitted to see.

Real world examples include:

Social networks like Facebook allow users to fully control their own data
but only allow their friends to view or comment on it. The user determines who can see their data, 
and by extension, whose data appears in their feed — authorization is a central part of the user experience!
The site you are on right now controls access to content: articles are visible to everyone, but only users who have 
logged in can edit them. To try this, click on the Edit button at the top of this page — if you are logged in you will be shown the edit view;

if you are not logged in you will be taken to the sign-up page.
Servers can send general or user-specific notifications through the website itself or via email, SMS, instant messaging,
video conversations, or other communications services.

A few examples include:

Facebook and Twitter send emails and SMS messages to notify you of new communications.
Amazon regularly sends product e-mails that suggest products similar to those already bought or viewed that you might be interested in.
A web server might send warning messages to site administrators alerting them to low memory on the server, or suspicious user activity.
